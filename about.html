    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>

    I'm a Senior year Computer Science student at Texas Tech University from Nepal. I will graduate in Fall 2021 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. I have always been fascinated by the fact that with some combination of circuits and lines of code, machines can come to life. More interestingly, these machines are capable of outrunning humans. Humans are smart but their capabilities are limited. Giving machines the power of artificial intelligence will let humans achieve milestones faster than humans normally would.

    With the information available online and the University resources, I have taught myself to code in C, C++, Python, Java, C#, MATLAB, and JavaScript. Learning the fundamental topics of Computer Science such as Data Structures and Object-Oriented Programming helped me write efficient codes and be more organized while building projects. Concepts of Programming language helped me understand the building blocks of all the programming languages and how every programming language are the big dogs in their own world.

    I contributed to research in Pilot Wave Theory by building an application in MATLAB to trace the particles and extract their properties from a video. MATLAB allowed me to communicate with the Engineers and Scientists through the language of programming and made me realize the possibilities of programming outside the field of Computer Science.

    These past few weeks I learnt React Native and built a Video Chat Application with Node.js, Express, Socket.io, and WebRTC to communicate with multiple users. 
    Occasionally, I like problem-solving with questions in Leetcode and Hacker Rank and build new programming projects.
