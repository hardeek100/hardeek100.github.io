    <h1>About</h1>

        <p>
            I'm a Senior year Computer Science student at Texas Tech University from Nepal. I will graduate on Fall 2021 with a Bachelor's
            degree in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. I have always been facinated by the fact that with some combination of circuits and lines of code, machines can come to life.
            More interestingly, these machines are capable of outrunning humans. Humans are smart but their capabilities are limited. Giving machines
            the power of artificial intelligence will let humans achieve milestones faster than what humans normally would.

            With the information available online and the University resources I have taught myself to code in C, C++, Python, Java, C#, MATLAB and JavaScript. Learning the fundamental topics of Computer
            Science such as Data Structures and Object-Oriented Programming helped me write efficient codes an be more organized while building projects. Concepts of Programming language helped me 
            understand the building blocks of all the programming languages and how every programming language are the big dogs in their own world.

            I contributed to a research in Pilot Wave Theory by building a application in MATLAB to trace the particles and extract their properties from a video. MATLAB allowed me to
             communicate with the Engineers and Scientist through the language of programming and made me realize the possibilites of programming outside the field of Computer Science.

            This past few weeks I learnt React Native and built a Video Chat Application with Node.js, Express, Socket.io and WebRTC to communicate with multiple users. Ocassionally, I like
            problem solving with questions in Leetcode and HackerRank. I have been learning Machine Learning and planning to build a new machine learning project using Reinforcement Learning.
